# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview
This is Tyler Wong's portfolio and resume repository - a personal documentation project focused on showcasing Unity game development experience, web development projects, and career progression. The repository contains structured markdown files documenting professional experience, published games, and career goals.

## Repository Structure & Purpose

### Core Documentation Files
- `GOALS.md` - Main project objectives for portfolio enhancement
- `linkedin-profile.md` - Complete professional profile with work experience, skills, and achievements
- `todos.md` - Prioritized action items for portfolio improvement and job search
- `interests.md` - Technical interests and specializations
- `job-requirements.md` - Specific job criteria and salary expectations

### Project Documentation
- `projects/unity-games/` - Detailed documentation of published Unity games with metrics
- `projects/unity-small-projects/` - Smaller Unity demonstrations and prototypes  
- `projects/web-projects/` - Web development portfolio pieces
- `assets/` - Media assets including screenshots, gifs, and promotional materials

### Key Professional Assets
- **Published Unity Games**: Puzzle Split (22.4% D7 retention), Car Fall 3D (3K+ downloads), Burn, Run Pom Run
- **Technical Stack**: Unity 3D, C#, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Node.js, PHP, Java
- **Professional Experience**: TruPlay Games (current), Tic Toc Games, Beach Day Studios, Liferay Inc.

## Development Context
This is a **documentation-only repository** with no executable code, build processes, or deployment requirements. All files are markdown-based content for portfolio presentation.

## Common Tasks

### Content Updates
- Modify existing markdown files to update professional information
- Add new project documentation following existing structure patterns
- Update metrics and achievements in project files

### Asset Management  
- Reference assets using relative paths: `assets/images/ProjectName/`
- Maintain consistent naming: `Feature Graphic.png`, `Logo.png`, numbered screenshots
- Keep backup assets in `assets/website-backup/` for legacy reference

### Portfolio Enhancement
- Follow prioritization in `todos.md` (High → Medium → Low priority)
- Maintain consistent professional tone across all documentation
- Include quantifiable metrics where available (downloads, retention rates, etc.)

## File Organization Patterns
- Unity games: Individual `.md` files with overview, metrics, technical details, and asset references
- Web projects: Focus on technical implementation and skills demonstrated
- Professional docs: Comprehensive but scannable format with clear sections and bullet points

## Professional Context
Primary goal is securing a Unity Developer position ($90K+, remote/hybrid near Chino, CA). Secondary interests include web development and passive income projects. All content should support job search and professional networking objectives.
